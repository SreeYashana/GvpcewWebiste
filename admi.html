              <p class="message-text">Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering for Women (GVPCEW) intends to develop the potential in students in order to nurture their creative and analytical mindset on various engineering aspects. GVPCEW believes that the purpose of engineering education is to not only focus on pure studies but also provide opportunity to explore the capabilities and their areas of interest. At GVPCEW we also believe that soft skills are very important towards managing and leveraging the various opportunities and challenges of the society. The exponential growth in technologies in the recent past has led to the creation of a knowledge-based society where knowledge has become quite important aspect of success. Accordingly, development of soft skills is given due emphasis through interaction with eminent personalities. All avenues are also being explored towards making the students industry ready . I would like to invite all those who wish to be part of this “Temple of Learning” to join “The Gayatri Vidya Parishad” family</p>

              <p class="message-text">I feel it as my privilege to work as a Professor of ECE and Director (R&D) in the prestigious college like GVP College of Engineering for Women. To uplift the image of the college, we are planning to organize various technical events in the campus with external funding from various organizations like SERB, DST, AICTE, DRDO and from professional bodies like IETE, CRSI which helps to update the knowledge of the faculty and students in the recent trends of technological growth. Any educational institution’s growth depends on its research component. The quality research undoubtedly brings good ranking to the college. This includes various parameters like sponsored projects, number of research publications in the SCI and Scopus indexed journals by the faculty, number of Ph.Ds available in the college and number of technical events being organized in the college. In the present day trend research is of prime importance apart from infrastructural facilities, teaching & learning processes for getting good accreditation grading and national level ranking for the college. Unless the institution is strong enough in its research background, it will be difficult to compete with other educational institutions.</p>
